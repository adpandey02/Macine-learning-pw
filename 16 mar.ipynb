    "Q1: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, leading to poor generalization on new data.\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "The consequences of overfitting include poor generalization and high variance, while the consequences of underfitting include\n",
    "poor performance on both training and new data and high bias. Overfitting can be mitigated by reducing the model's complexity, \n",
    "increasing the size and diversity of the training data, and using regularization techniques. Underfitting can be mitigated by\n",
    "increasing the model's complexity, adding more features, and using a more powerful model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: To reduce overfitting, we can use techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping.\n",
    "Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from fitting the noise in the data. \n",
    "Cross-validation can be used to select the best hyperparameters for the model, while early stopping can be used to prevent the \n",
    "model from overfitting by stopping the training process when the validation loss stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "This can occur when the training data is insufficient, the model is too basic, or the features are not representative enough.\n",
    "For example, if we use a linear model to fit a nonlinear relationship between the input and output variables, we may encounter underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the relationship between the bias and variance of a machine learning model.\n",
    "Bias measures the systematic error in the model, while variance measures the random error. A model with high bias tends to underfit the data,\n",
    "while a model with high variance tends to overfit the data.\n",
    "Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for achieving optimal model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting include cross-validation,\n",
    "plotting the learning curve, and evaluating the model on a separate validation set.\n",
    "If the training error is much lower than the validation error, the model may be overfitting. \n",
    "If both the training and validation errors are high, the model may be underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Bias measures the systematic error in the model, while variance measures the random error. \n",
    "A high bias model tends to underfit the data, while a high variance model tends to overfit the data.\n",
    "For example, a linear regression model with few features may have high bias, while a complex neural network with many layers may \n",
    "have high variance. High bias models may have poor training and test error, while high variance models may have low training error \n",
    "but high test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping. L1 regularization adds a penalty\n",
    "term based on the absolute value of the weights, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term based on the squared value of the weights.\n",
    "Dropout randomly drops out some of the neurons during training to prevent overfitting, while early stopping stops the training process\n",
    "when the validation loss stops improving to prevent overfitting.\n",
