    "Q1. Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection as it helps to identify the most\n",
    "relevant features or attributes that can distinguish between normal and anomalous instances\n",
    "The aim is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and remove irrelevant, redundant, or noisy \n",
    "features that can lead to false alarms or poor performance of the detection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Some common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection algorithms include precision, recall,\n",
    "F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC-ROC. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all\n",
    "positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives\n",
    "F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. ROC curve plots the true positive rate\n",
    "against the false positive rate for different thresholds, and AUC-ROC measures the area under\n",
    "the ROC curve, which indicates the overall performance of the algorithm.\n",

    "Q3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm \n",
    "that groups together data points that are closely packed together in a high-density region, while \n",
    "marking data points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers. It works by defining a \n",
    "neighborhood around each data point and identifying dense regions based on the number of points\n",
    "in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The epsilon parameter in DBSCAN determines the radius of the neighborhood around each data point\n",
    "which affects the sensitivity of the algorithm in detecting clusters and outliers. A smaller value\n",
    "of epsilon leads to tighter clusters and more outliers, while a larger value of epsilon leads to \n",
    "larger clusters and fewer outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In DBSCAN, core points are data points that have at least minPts number of neighbors within a\n",
    "distance of epsilon, and lie in a high-density region. Border points have fewer neighbors than minPts\n",
    "within a distance of epsilon, but are within the neighborhood of a core point. Noise points are data\n",
    "points that do not belong to any cluster and have fewer than minPts neighbors within a distance\n",
    "of epsilon. Anomalous points can be either border or noise points, depending on their distance and \n",
    "density compared to other data points.\n",

    "Q6. DBSCAN detects anomalies by assigning data points that do not belong to any cluster as outliers\n",
    "or noise points, based on their distance and density compared to other data points. The key parameters\n",
    "involved in the process are epsilon, which determines the radius of the neighborhood, minPts\n",
    "which determines the minimum number of neighbors required to form a dense region, and the distance\n",
    "metric used to measure the distance between data points.\n",

    "Q7. The make_circles package in scikit-learn is a utility function that generates a 2D dataset \n",

    "Q8. Local outliers are data points that are considered anomalous in their immediate neighborhood\n",
    "but may not be anomalous globally in the entire dataset. Global outliers are data points that are \n",
    "anomalous compared to the entire dataset, regardless of their local neighborhood. The difference \n",
    "between local and global outliers depends on the scale and scope of the anomaly detection task, and\n",
    "the context of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Local outliers can be detected using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm by measuring the\n",
    "density of a data point compared to its k-nearest neighbors, and comparing it to the densities of \n",
    "the surrounding regions. A data point with a significantly lower density than its neighbors is \n",
    "considered a local outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Global outliers can be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm by randomly partitioning\n",
    "the dataset into subsets and recursively isolating the outliers based on their random projections \n",
    "along the features. The algorithm measures the average path length of each data point in the forest\n",
    "and assigns anomaly scores based on the number of partitions required to isolate it.\n",

    "Q11. Local outlier detection is more appropriate when anomalies occur in specific regions of the\n",
    "dataset, while global outlier detection is more appropriate when anomalies are spread throughout\n",
    "the dataset.\n",
    "Some examples of real-world applications where local outlier detection is more appropriate include:\n",
    "Fraud detection in credit card transactions: In this case, the anomalies are likely to be local to\n",
    "a particular region, such as a specific merchant or geographic area.\n",
    "Network intrusion detection: In this case, the anomalies are likely to be local to a specific host\n",
    "or network segment, rather than affecting the entire network.\n",
    "Medical diagnosis: In this case, the anomalies may be local to specific organs or regions of the body\n",
    "rather than affecting the entire patient.\n",
    "On the other hand, some examples of real-world applications where global outlier detection is more\n",
    "appropriate include:\n",
    "Sensor network monitoring: In this case, the anomalies may occur randomly throughout the network\n",
