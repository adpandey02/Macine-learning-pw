    "Q1. A contingency matrix is a table that shows the number of true positives, true\n",
    "negatives, false positives, and false negatives for a binary classification problem\n",
    "It is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels \n",
    "with the actual labels. The matrix provides a clear visualization of the errors made by the model and helps to calculate various performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. A pair confusion matrix is a type of confusion matrix that is used to evaluate the performance\n",
    "of multi-label classification models. Unlike a regular confusion matrix, a pair confusion matrix \n",
    "shows the number of times each pair of labels is predicted correctly or incorrectly. Pair confusion\n",
    "matrices can be useful in certain situations where the labels are not mutually exclusive, and \n",
    "multiple labels can be assigned to a single instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. An extrinsic measure in the context of natural language processing (NLP) is a metric that \n",
    "evaluates the performance of a language model based on its performance in a downstream task\n",
    "such as text classification or machine translation. It is typically used to assess how well \n",
    "the language model performs in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. An intrinsic measure in the context of machine learning is a metric that evaluates the \n",
    "performance of a model based on its internal quality, such as how well it represents the training\n",
    "data or how well it generalizes to new data. Intrinsic measures are often used to evaluate\n",
    "unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning is to evaluate the performance of a\n",
    "classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels. It provides a \n",
    "clear visualization of the errors made by the model and helps to calculate various performance\n",
    "metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The confusion matrix can be used \n",
    "to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the model and to determine areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Some common intrinsic measures used to evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning \n",
    "algorithms include clustering validity indices, such as the Silhouette Coefficient and the \n",
    "Davies-Bouldin Index, and dimensionality reduction measures, such as reconstruction error and \n",
    "explained variance. These measures provide insights into the quality of the learned\n",
    "representations and can be used to compare different models or hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. One limitation of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks is \n",
    "that it does not take into account class imbalance, where some classes may have many more instances\n",
    "than others. Another limitation is that accuracy does not distinguish between different types \n",
    "of errors, such as false positives and false negatives. These limitations can be addressed by using\n",
    "additional metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve, that provide\n",
    "a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, techniques such as resampling,\n",
    "cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods can be used to address class imbalance and improve\n",
    "the performance of the model"
