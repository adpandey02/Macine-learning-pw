    "A1. The decision tree classifier is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks.\n",
    "The algorithm builds a tree-like model based on the input features and their corresponding target variables.\n",
    "Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents\n",
    "a class label. To make a prediction, the algorithm traverses the tree starting at the root node and \n",
    "follows the path based on the input feature values until it reaches a leaf node, which provides the\n",
    "predicted class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. The decision tree classifier algorithm uses a recursive partitioning process to split the data \n",
    "into subsets based on the most significant feature. The algorithm selects the feature that results \n",
    "in the highest reduction in impurity or increase in information gain, and splits the data into two\n",
    "subsets based on the values of that feature. This process is repeated for each subset until a \n",
    "stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or minimum number of samples in a leaf node.\n",
    "The impurity or information gain can be calculated using various measures such as entropy or Gini index.\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. In a binary classification problem, a decision tree classifier can be used to predict the class label\n",
    "of a sample as either 0 or 1. The algorithm splits the data based on the feature values that provide the\n",
    "highest reduction in impurity or increase in information gain, and assigns the majority class label of \n",
    "the subset to the corresponding leaf node. To make a prediction for a new sample, the algorithm \n",
    "follows the path from the root node to a leaf node based on the feature values, and assigns the\n",
    "corresponding class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification is that the algorithm partitions \n",
    "the feature space into regions, where each region corresponds to a different decision or class label.\n",
    "The partitions are axis-parallel, meaning they are aligned with the axes of the feature space. \n",
    "The decision boundary between two regions is a hyperplane that is orthogonal to one of the feature axes.\n",
    "To make a prediction for a new sample, the algorithm checks which region the sample belongs to based\n",
    "on the feature values, and assigns the corresponding class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the classification results of a model by comparing\n",
    "the predicted class labels to the true class labels of a set of samples. \n",
    "It consists of four metrics: true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), \n",
    "and false negatives (FN). TP is the number of samples that are correctly predicted as positive,\n",
    "FP is the number of samples that are incorrectly predicted as positive, TN is the number of\n",
    "samples that are correctly predicted as negative, and FN is the number of samples that are\n",
    "incorrectly predicted as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A6. An example confusion matrix for a binary classification problem is shown below:\n",
    "Predicted Positive Predicted Negative\n",
    "True Positive         100       10\n",
    "False Positive         20       50\n",
    "True Negative         500       100\n",
    "False Negative         30       70\n",
    "From this confusion matrix, precision can be calculated as TP / (TP + FP) = 100 / (100 + 20) = 0.83,\n",
    "recall can be calculated as TP / (TP + FN) = 100 / (100 + 30) = 0.77, and F1 score can be calculated \n",
    "as 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) = 2 * 0.83 * 0.77 / (0.83 + 0.77) = 0.80.\n",
    "\n",
    "A7. Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for a classification problem is important because \n",
    "different metrics may prioritize different aspects of model performance. For example, precision may\n",
    "be more important than recall in a medical diagnosis problem where a false positive can have \n",
    "severe consequences, while recall may be more important in a fraud detection problem where a false \n",
    "negative can result in significant financial losses. One approach to choosing an appropriate evaluation\n",
    "metric is to consider the specific problem and the costs associated with different types of errors,\n",
    "and select the metric that best aligns with the objectives of the problem. Additionally,\n",
    "it can be useful to consider multiple metrics and their trade-offs, such as the precision-recall \n",
    "trade-off, and select a metric or combination of metrics that provides a balance between different \n",
    "aspects of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A8. An example of a classification problem where precision is the most important metric is in spam\n",
    "email detection. In this problem, false positives, or incorrectly classifying legitimate emails as\n",
    "spam, can be highly detrimental as they may cause important emails to be missed. Thus, precision, \n",
    "which measures the proportion of correctly classified positive samples among all samples predicted\n",
    "as positive, is a critical metric in this scenario. Maximizing precision can help to minimize the\n",
    "number of false positives and ensure that legitimate emails are not mistakenly identified as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "A9. An example of a classification problem where recall is the most important metric is in cancer diagnosis.\n",
    "In this problem, false negatives, or incorrectly diagnosing a patient with no cancer as having cancer,\n",
    "can be life-threatening as it may result in delayed treatment and progression of the disease. \n",
    "Therefore, recall, which measures the proportion of correctly classified positive samples among\n",
    "all actual positive samples, is a critical metric in this scenario. Maximizing recall can help to\n",
    "ensure that all patients with cancer are correctly diagnosed and receive timely treatment.\n",
